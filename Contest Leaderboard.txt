You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.


select
    m.hacker_id,
    h.name,
    sum(m.score) as tot_score
from 
    (
        select hacker_id, challenge_id, max(score) as score
        from submissions
        group by hacker_id, challenge_id
    ) as m
join hackers as h on m.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
group by m.hacker_id, h.name
having tot_score != 0
order by tot_score desc, m.hacker_id
;

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Input Format
The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:



SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN A+B <= C || B+C <= A || A+C <= B THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A=B && B=C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A=B || B=C || A=C THEN 'Isosceles'
        WHEN A!=B && B!=C && A!=C THEN 'Scalene'
    END
FROM TRIANGLES;

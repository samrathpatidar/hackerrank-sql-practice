You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.

Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.




select a.x, a.y from
(select x, y from Functions) a,
(select x, y from Functions) b
where a.x = b.y && b.x = a.y && a.x < a.y
union
SELECT x, y 
FROM   functions 
WHERE  x = y 
GROUP  BY x,y 
HAVING Count(*) > 1
order by x,y
;

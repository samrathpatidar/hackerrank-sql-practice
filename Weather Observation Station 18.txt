Consider p1(a,b)  and p2(cod) to be two points on a 2D plane.
 A happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 B happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 C happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 D happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points p1 and p2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

SELECT CONVERT(((MAX(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N))+(MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W))),DECIMAL(7,4)) FROM STATION;

Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.


select challenges.hacker_id, hackers.name, count(challenges.challenge_id) from hackers
join challenges on challenges.hacker_id = hackers.hacker_id
group by challenges.hacker_id, hackers.name
HAVING count(challenges.challenge_id) = 
            (
                SELECT count(c1.challenge_id) FROM Challenges AS c1
                GROUP BY c1.hacker_id
                ORDER BY count(*) desc limit 1
            )
                or
count(challenges.challenge_id) NOT IN 
            (
                SELECT count(c2.challenge_id) FROM Challenges AS c2
                GROUP BY c2.hacker_id 
                HAVING c2.hacker_id != Challenges.hacker_id
            )
order by 3 desc, 1
